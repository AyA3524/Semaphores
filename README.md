# Semaphores
A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to control access to a shared resource. It is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access by multiple processes or threads to a common resource in a parallel programming environment.
Semaphores can be thought of as a counter with two main operations:
P (Produce) Operation (also known as wait or down):
If the counter is greater than 0, decrement it.
If the counter is already 0, the process or thread is blocked until it becomes greater than 0.
V (Consume) Operation (also known as signal or up):
Increment the counter.
If there are processes or threads waiting due to a previous P operation, wake up one of them.
The primary purpose of semaphores is to solve the critical section problem and avoid race conditions in concurrent systems. They are particularly useful in scenarios where multiple processes or threads need to access shared resources simultaneously without interfering with each other.
Semaphores can be classified into two types:
Binary Semaphores:
Also known as mutexes (mutual exclusion).
Can have only two values: 0 or 1.
Used for binary signaling, often for protecting critical sections.
Counting Semaphores:
Can have values greater than 1.
Used for managing resources where multiple units can be allocated or released.
Here's a simple example to illustrate the basic concept:

Semaphore mutex = 1;  // Binary semaphore (mutex)

Process A:
    P(mutex);         // Entry to critical section
    // Critical section code
    V(mutex);         // Exit from critical section

Process B:
    P(mutex);         // Entry to critical section
    // Critical section code
    V(mutex);         // Exit from critical section
    
In this example, the semaphore mutex is used to control access to a critical section of code. The P operation is performed before entering the critical section, and the V operation is performed after exiting the critical section. This ensures that only one process can execute the critical section at a time, preventing race conditions.
